# [LIVE REACT NEWS APP](https://final.farukaydogan.com)

## Available Scripts

Welcome to our news website! We are proud to present a dynamic platform built with React, a powerful JavaScript library for creating interactive user interfaces. Our website fetches the latest news from various sources using APIs, ensuring that you have access to the most up-to-date and reliable information.

With React, we have designed a seamless and intuitive browsing experience that allows you to explore a wide range of news categories. From breaking news to sports, entertainment, technology, and more, our website covers diverse topics to cater to your interests.

One of the key advantages of using React is its component-based architecture, which enables us to create modular and reusable UI elements. This approach not only enhances the development process but also ensures a consistent and efficient user experience across different devices.

We understand the importance of staying informed, and our goal is to provide you with a user-friendly platform that delivers news in a visually appealing and engaging manner. By leveraging the power of React, we can continuously improve and expand our features to meet your evolving needs.

Thank you for choosing our news website. We are dedicated to delivering high-quality news content and an exceptional user experience. If you have any feedback or suggestions, please feel free to reach out to us. Stay tuned for the latest updates!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
